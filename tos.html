<h2>TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF USE</h2>

<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
<p>These Terms and Conditions of Use (these "Terms") describe the terms and conditions under which Triarii Capital Management, LP and its affiliates ("Triarii Capital"), will permit persons who visit this Web site (the "Triarii Capital Site") to use the site and the services that Triarii Capital may make available on or through it (the "Services"), including, without limitation, (1) persons who are authorized to use specified secure areas of this site ("Authorized Users") in conjunction with separate written subscription agreements with Triarii Capital (the "Subscription Agreements") and (2) other persons who visit the Triarii Capital Site but who are not authorized to use such secure areas (Authorized Users and other visitors collectively referred to as "you"). Please read these Terms carefully and refer to them as often as necessary. These Terms and the Subscription Agreement(s), if any, provide all of the applicable Triarii Capital requirements and comprise the entire agreement between you and Triarii Capital with respect to the Triarii Capital Site and the Services.</p>

<h3>2. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS THROUGH USE</h3>
<p>By using the Triarii Capital Site, you signify your agreement to all terms, conditions, and notices contained or referenced in these Terms. If you do not agree to these Terms, you are not permitted to use the Triarii Capital Site. Triarii Capital reserves the right, at its discretion, to update or revise these Terms. Please check these Terms periodically for changes. Your continued use of the Triarii Capital Site following the posting of any changes to these Terms constitutes acceptance of those changes.</p>

<h3>3. USER CONDUCT</h3>
<p>If you are an Authorized User, your user name and password will be your identity for purposes of interacting with the Triarii Capital Site. You will use your password solely in accordance with this Agreement and notify Triarii Capital if you learn of or suspect any loss, theft or unauthorized use of your password.
You agree not to use the Triarii Capital Site for any unlawful purpose. You agree not to attempt to gain access to any area of the site and any information for which you have not previously received authorization in writing. You also acknowledge and agree that Triarii Capital has put into place security measures designed to prevent unauthorized access to the information of other Authorized Users, and should you gain access to any information for which you have not received prior authorization, you will not view, download, print, harvest or collect, or attempt to view, download, print, harvest or collect, any such information. You also agree that you will not upload or attempt to upload any content (including text, communications, software, images, sounds, data, or other information) that contains software viruses or any other computer code, files, or programs that are designed or intended to disrupt, damage, or limit the functioning of any software, hardware, or telecommunications equipment or to damage or obtain unauthorized access to any data or other information of any third party.</p>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that, although Triarii Capital has implemented and uses its best efforts to maintain security measures designed to prevent the unauthorized access by visitors and other Authorized Users to the information that you are authorized to access and use, no security measures are available that can be 100% guaranteed to prevent such unauthorized access. Triarii Capital therefore does not warrant that such security measures will prevent such unauthorized access in each and every instance.</p>
<p>You further agree that you will not harvest or collect, or attempt to harvest or collect, information about other Authorized Users and other visitors to the Triarii Capital Site or use such information for the purpose of transmitting or facilitating transmission of unsolicited bulk electronic mail or communications.</p>

<h3>4. THIRD PARTY SITES</h3>
<p>The Triarii Capital Site may link you to other sites on the Internet. These sites may contain information or material that some people may find inappropriate or offensive. These other sites are not under the control of Triarii Capital, and you acknowledge that Triarii Capital is not responsible for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, decency, or any other aspect of the content of such sites. The inclusion of such a link does not imply endorsement of the site by Triarii Capital or any association with its operators.</p>

<h3>5. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h3>
<p>You acknowledge and agree that all content and materials available on the Triarii Capital Site are protected by copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, or other proprietary rights and laws. Except as may be expressly authorized by Triarii Capital under a separate written agreement, you agree not to sell, license, rent, modify, distribute, copy, reproduce, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, publish, adapt, edit, or create derivative works from such materials or content. Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, and unless Triarii Capital grants you broader rights under such separate written agreement, you are granted a limited license to print or download one copy of the materials or content on the Triarii Capital Site on any single computer for your personal, non-commercial use, provided you keep intact all copyright and other proprietary notices; subject, however, to any express terms and conditions displayed with such materials or content. Systematic retrieval of data or other content from the Triarii Capital Site to create or compile, directly or indirectly, a collection, compilation, database or directory without written permission from Triarii Capital is prohibited. In addition, use of the content or materials for any purpose not expressly permitted in these Terms is prohibited. Except as expressly provided above, all rights are reserved.</p>
<p>As discussed above, reproduction, copying, or redistribution for commercial purposes of any materials or design elements on the Triarii Capital Site is strictly prohibited without the express written permission of Triarii Capital or as provided in a separate written agreement with Triarii Capital. Among other things, except to the extent required for the limited purpose of reviewing material on the Triarii Capital Site, electronic reproduction, adaptation, distribution, performance or display is prohibited. Use of any of Triarii Capital's trademarks as metatags on other Web sites also is strictly prohibited. You may not display this Web site in frames (or any of the content or materials via in-line links) without our express written permission. Permission to use certain content or materials in a manner prohibited by this Section 5 is granted only when certain limited criteria are met.</p>

<h3>6. PRIVACY</h3>
<p>Triarii Capital uses the personally identifiable information that it gathers primarily to communicate with you and, generally, it does not share this information with third parties. Triarii Capital uses return email addresses to answer the email that it receives. Such addresses are not used for any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. However, Triarii Capital may disclose such information if it has received your permission beforehand or in very special circumstances, such as when it believes that such disclosure is required by law or other special cases described below.</p>
<p>Triarii Capital may also disclose personally identifiable information in special cases when it has reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against you or someone else who may be violating these Terms or may be causing injury to or interference (either intentionally or unintentionally) with Triarii Capital's rights or property, other users of the Triarii Capital Site, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities. Triarii Capital may disclose or access personally identifiable information when it believes in good faith that the law requires it and for administrative and other purposes that it deems necessary to maintain, service, and improve its products and services.</p>
<p>Triarii Capital does not sell or rent personally identifiable user information to anyone. Triarii Capital will notify you at the time of data collection or transfer if your data will be shared with a third party, and you will always have the option of not permitting the transfer.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, no data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100% secure. As a result, while Triarii Capital strives to protect your personally identifiable information, it cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information that you transmit to it, and you do so at your own risk. Once Triarii Capital receives your transmission, it makes its best effort within the Triarii Capital Site to ensure the security of the information on Triarii Capital's systems.
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, Triarii Capital has put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information it collects online.</p>
<p>Providers and/or third parties linked to our Web Site have separate privacy and data collection practices. Triarii Capital has no responsibility or liability for these independent policies. For more information regarding each provider, its site, and its privacy policies, return to that provider's home page and click on its information link.</p>

<h3>7. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES</h3>
<p>ALL MATERIALS, INFORMATION, SOFTWARE, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN OR AVAILABLE THROUGH THE TRIARII CAPITAL SITE (THE "CONTENT") ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE" FOR YOUR USE. THE CONTENT IS PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NONINFRINGEMENT. TRIARII CAPITAL AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE CONTENT IS ACCURATE, RELIABLE OR CORRECT; THAT THE TRIARII CAPITAL SITE WILL BE AVAILABLE AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME OR LOCATION; THAT ANY DEFECTS OR ERRORS WILL BE CORRECTED; THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR MISAPPROPRIATION OF THE CONTENT WILL NOT OCCUR; OR THAT THE CONTENT IS FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS. YOUR USE OF THE TRIARII CAPITAL SITE IS SOLELY AT YOUR RISK. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT PERMIT THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN WARRANTIES, THESE EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<h3>8. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h3>
<p>UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL TRIARII CAPITAL, ITS SUBSIDIARIES, OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT FROM THE USE OF, OR INABILITY TO USE, THE TRIARII CAPITAL SITE, OR THE UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO OR THE MISAPPROPRIATION OF ANY CONTENT MADE AVAILABLE ON OR THROUGH THE TRIARII CAPITAL SITE. THIS LIMITATION APPLIES WHETHER THE ALLEGED LIABILITY IS BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR ANY OTHER BASIS, EVEN IF TRIARII CAPITAL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE. BECAUSE SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, TRIARII CAPITAL'S LIABILITY IN SUCH JURISDICTIONS WILL BE LIMITED TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.</p>

<h3>9. INDEMNIFICATION</h3>
<p>Upon a request by Triarii Capital, you agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless Triarii Capital, its subsidiaries and other affiliated companies, and the employees, contractors, officers, and directors of each of them from all liabilities, claims, and expenses, including attorney's fees, that arise from your use or misuse of the Triarii Capital Site. Triarii Capital reserves the right, at it own expense, to assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will cooperate with Triarii Capital in asserting any available defenses.</p>

<h3>10. INTERNATIONAL USE</h3>
<p>Triarii Capital Capital and its affiliated companies may provide investment management services to clients in the US, the European Union and in many other countries around the world.  Those who access the Triarii Capital Site do so on their own initiative and are responsible for establishing the legality under any or all applicable jurisdictions and compliance with local laws.</p>

<h3>11. CHOICE OF LAW AND FORUM</h3>
<p>These Terms will be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. You expressly agree that the exclusive jurisdiction for any claim or action arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Triarii Capital Site will be filed only in the state or federal courts located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and you further agree and submit to the exercise of personal jurisdiction of such courts for the purpose of litigating any such claim or action.</p>

<h3>12. DISPUTE RESOLUTION</h3>
<p>All disputes arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of the Triarii Capital Site ("Disputes") will be settled by final and binding arbitration conducted in Massachusetts, by a neutral arbitrator, in accordance with these Terms and the then-current commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Each party will bear its own expenses, except that the prevailing party may recover the filing costs and the expenses of the arbitrator from the other party. Any award of the arbitrator will be in writing and will state the reasons for the award. Judgment upon an award may be entered in any court having competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will not have the power to order pre-hearing discovery of documents or the taking of depositions, but may compel attendance of witnesses and the production of documents at the hearing. The parties, their representatives and participants and the arbitrator will hold the existence, content and result of the arbitration in confidence, except to the limited extent necessary to enforce a final settlement agreement or to obtain or enforce a judgment on an arbitration decision and award. Any Disputes relating to your failure to pay billed charges for the Services are exempt from the requirement of binding arbitration. You agree that Triarii Capital will be entitled to obtain preliminary injunctive relief to enforce any of these Terms against you pending a final determination in arbitration.</p>

<h3>13. SEVERABILITY AND INTEGRATION</h3>
<p>Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement, together with your obligations with respect to the Subscription Agreement(s), if any, under which you are authorized to use the Services (as such obligations are set forth in Section 1 of these Terms), constitutes the entire agreement between you and Triarii Capital with respect to the Triarii Capital Site and the Services, and supersedes all other prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals (whether oral, written, or electronic) between you and Triarii Capital with respect to the Triarii Capital Site and the Services. In the event of a conflict between these Terms and the Subscription Agreement(s), if any, under which you are authorized to use the Services, then the terms of such Subscription Agreement(s) shall govern. If any part of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable, that portion will be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect, as nearly as possible, the original intentions of the parties, and the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect.</p>

<h3>14. TERMINATION</h3>
<p>Triarii Capital reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate your access to all or part of the Triarii Capital Site, with or without notice.  </p>
